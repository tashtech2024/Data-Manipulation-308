// Part 1: Growing Pains//

// Your task is to create a program that advises a group of environmental scientists how to handle the growth and spread of a unique plant species under their supervision. You must develop a growth control system that will monitor and predict the plant growth, making decisions based on the available space and potential growth.

// Here is the information you have been given:
// The area in which the plants are contained is circular, with a radius of 5 meters.
// The formula for calculating the area of a circle is PI multiplied by the radius, squared:const PI = 3.1415; const area = PI * radius * radius;
// Each plant requires a minimum space of 0.8 square meters.
// The area is starting with 20 plants.
// The plants double in number every week.
// Using this information, your objectives are to:
// Predict the plant growth after a specific number of weeks.
// Implement control flow to make decisions on whether the plants should be:
// Pruned, to stop them from exceeding the capacity of the garden.
// This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of weeks is greater than 80% of the maximum capacity of the garden.
// Monitored, if they are growing at an acceptable rate.
// This condition should be met if the plant count is between 50% and 80% of the maximum capacity of the garden after the given number of weeks.
// Planted, if there is room to plant more plants.
// This condition should be met if the plant count after the given number of weeks is less than 50% of the maximum capacity of the garden.
